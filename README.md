Title: Bakery

My Broken Program Will simulate you working in a bakery. You can either order raw or precooked breads. And you can feed them to the customer.

My program can, make customers, let you order stuff, lets you bake stuff.

My main classes are Food, Execute, Customers, Spoil, Time, And Bakery, My Execute uses almost all the classes inorder to run the simulation. Food and Spoil or Superclass Food, subclass Spoil. I use ArrayList to Store Foods and store customers names. 

You can compile everyclass except for the Time Class. You can input what foods you want to orde or bake
Bugs: There are SO MUCH that it will take me hours to list them all so heres some, When baking again, the food duplicate due to it adding the foods again. The Feed does NOT work.
